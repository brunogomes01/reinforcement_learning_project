# Reinforcement Learning Project  
## Agent-Based Decision Making Using Reinforcement Learning

---

## 📌 Overview

This project explores **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** techniques to design an intelligent agent capable of learning optimal actions through interaction with an environment.

The goal is to demonstrate how an agent can improve its decision-making process over time using reward-based feedback, simulating real-world adaptive systems.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Traditional rule-based systems are limited when dealing with dynamic and uncertain environments.

Reinforcement Learning addresses this limitation by enabling agents to:
- Learn from experience
- Optimize long-term cumulative rewards
- Adapt behavior based on environmental feedback

This project applies these concepts in a practical, experimental context.

---

## 🧠 Methodology

The project follows a standard Reinforcement Learning workflow:

1. Environment definition  
2. Agent initialization  
3. Action selection based on a policy  
4. Reward feedback from the environment  
5. Policy update and learning convergence  

Depending on the implementation, the project may involve:
- Q-Learning  
- Exploration vs. exploitation strategies  
- Value-based or policy-based approaches
